Emerging interactive technologies are rapidly transforming the ways in which we work, play, communicate, and learn. Research on tangible interaction attempts to blur the line between digital technologies and the broader physical, social, and cultural worlds within which computer use is situated. This course will explore the use of tangible interaction to create innovative learning experiences and will review both theoretical and technological foundations of the field. Topics may include distributed cognition, embodied interaction, cultural forms, and tangible interaction frameworks.
